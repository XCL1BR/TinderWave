# Tinder Web Effect Project

## Overview

This project is a dynamic web page featuring a Tinder-style effect, created using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. Users can interact with the page by clicking a button to switch between different tiles, offering a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tinder-web-effect.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tinder-web-effect
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. **For the best visual experience, use the inspect mode to view the project**. Since this project is designed as a replica of a mobile app, viewing it on a standard web browser might not do justice to the intended user experience. By using the inspect mode, you can emulate mobile device dimensions and interactions, providing a more accurate representation of how the interface and transitions will look and feel on an actual mobile device.
   - To enter inspect mode, right-click on the webpage and select "Inspect" or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`Cmd+Option+I` on Mac).
   - Click on the device toolbar button (icon of a phone and tablet) to toggle the device mode.
   - Choose a mobile device from the dropdown menu to emulate that device's screen size and resolution.
3. Click the button to switch between different tiles and observe the smooth transition effects.
